Be Kind â€” favicon page
----------------------

This tiny HTML page embeds a pink "Be Kind" icon as a favicon.
Bookmarking the HTTPS URL of this page will show your custom icon in
Chrome's bookmarks bar. (Chrome does not attach favicons to data: or
file: bookmarks, which is why the earlier trick didn't persist.)

How to use:
1) Host this page anywhere that serves plain HTML over HTTPS
   (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, Neocities).
2) Copy the public URL once it's live.
3) Create a bookmark to that URL and name it "Be Kind" (or add an emoji).

You can also just open index.html locally to see the icon in the tab,
but Chrome won't show favicons for file:// bookmarks in the bar.
